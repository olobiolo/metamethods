\title{create S3 method for class \code{grouped_df}}
\usage{
data.frame__to__grouped_df(fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{fun}{a function; this must be an S3 method for class \code{data.frame};
also, its first argument must be named \code{x}}
}
\value{
a function: a method for class \code{grouped_df} (from package \code{dplyr})
}
\description{
Given an S3 method for class \code{data.frame}, create an S3 method
for class \code{grouped_df} for the same generic function.
}
\details{
This is a utility function for writing packages.
Functions that modify data frames by replacing or adding columns may fail
on grouped data frames so the class will require a dedicated method.
This is a generalized constructor of such methods.

In all cases the original call to \code{foo} is captured with \code{match.call}
and reconstructed into a call to the \code{data.frame} method.
Grouping variables are isolated as a list, and the first argument of \code{foo},
which must be named \code{x}, is split into a list with \code{split}, using the
list of grouping variables as splitting factors. Empty levels are dropped.
The list is then passed to \code{lapply}, with the call to the \code{data.frame} method
as \code{FUN}. The result is reconstituted into a single \code{data.frame} with
\code{unsplit}, again dropping empty levels.
}
\section{How to use}{

When creating an .R file for generic \code{foo} and its S3 methods,
simply add another entry where \code{foo.grouped_df} is defined as the result of
\code{data.frame__to__grouped_df} acting on \code{foo.data.frame}.

Copy the following \code{roxygen} tag before the function definition
to have it show up nicely in the documentation file:

\code{@describeIn foo see \\code{\\link[metamethods]{data.frame__to__grouped_df}}}
}
